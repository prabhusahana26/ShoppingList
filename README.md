# ShoppingList
This project is a simple Shopping List App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to manage a shopping list interactively. Users can add items to the list by entering text and clicking the "Add Item" button. Each item in the list has a remove button, allowing users to delete individual items. There is also a "Clear All" button to delete all items at once. Additionally, the app provides a filter feature that lets users search for specific items in the list by typing into a filter input field. The user interface dynamically updates, hiding or showing certain controls, such as the filter and clear buttons, based on the number of items in the list.
